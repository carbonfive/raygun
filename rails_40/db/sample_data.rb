# Populate the database with a small set of realistic sample data so that as a developer/designer, you can use the
# application without having to create a bunch of stuff or pull down production data.
#
# After running db:sample_data, a developer/designer should be able to fire up the app, sign in, browse data and see
# examples of practically anything (interesting) that can happen in the system.
#
# It's a good idea to build this up along with the features; when you build a feature, make sure you can easily demo it
# after running db:sample_data.
#
# Data that is required by the application across all environments (i.e. reference data) should _not_ be included here.
# That belongs in seeds.rb instead.
